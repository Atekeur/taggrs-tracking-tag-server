# Taggrs Tracking Tag (Server)

Taggrs has been developed for and by marketers. Our goal is to make the best tracking accessible to every company. Tracking can make or break your marketing campaigns, but good tracking is becoming increasingly complex. Changing laws and new requirements in the field of privacy are making it more difficult to obtain good data.

With Taggrs, we put you back in control. With server-side tagging, you are in charge of your data and have 100% insight and accuracy. Use the data for analysis or to measure conversions. You decide.

The TAGGRS tracking tag can be used to measure and compare your data with the server side on the TAGGRS dashboard.
